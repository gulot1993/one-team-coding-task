How to run the app:
    - clone the repository using git clone command (git clone git@github.com:gulot1993/one-team-coding-task.git)
    - open the file in Android Studio (Koala version)
    - connect your android phone using USB cable and enable your developers options in settings
    - run the app


About the app:

Programming language:
    - kotlin - I used this language because it is recommended by Google and at the same time
    it reduces boilerplate codes

IDE:
    - Android Studio - The IDE for Android Development


Design Pattern:
    - MVVM - I used MVVM because aside that it is recommended by google, it's because
    MVVM is easier to develop, maintain and testing.
    - Repository Pattern - I used repository pattern because it is easier to manipulate data from different sources

Database:
    - Room DB - it is the most commonly used database in android development

Dependency Injection:
    - Hilt - it is much easier to implement than dagger 

Needs Improvement:
    - UIs - need to load the image based on what level and states (currently it is static)
    also tablayout should be paired with viewpager (currently it has no viewpager)
    - Getting and Clearing Data - Currently the app clears the data when opening the app then add the data 
    from API, it's an expensive operation.
    

That's all. Thank you
